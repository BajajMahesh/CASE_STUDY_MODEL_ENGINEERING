**Credit Card Routing Project**

Objective 1: Credit Card Routing for Online Purchases Using Predictive Modeling
Project Context

As a data scientist at one of the globe's largest retail corporations, you're confronted with a challenge: the high failure rate in online credit card transactions. The existing manual and rule-based payment service provider (PSP) routing system is leading to financial losses and dissatisfied customers. The objective is to implement predictive modeling to automate credit card routing, aiming to boost payment success rates while minimizing transaction costs.

Project Objective
Automate credit card routing using predictive modeling to enhance payment success rates and reduce transaction fees.

Dataset
The dataset, along with pertinent details like PSP names and transaction fees, is stored in a separate *zip-folder: use_case_1.zip PSP_Jan_Feb_2019.xlsx.

Key Columns:
- tmsp: Transaction timestamp.
- country: Transaction country.
- amount: Transaction amount.
- success: Indicates successful payment (1 for success, 0 for failure).
- PSP: Payment service provider.
- 3D_secured: Indicates 3D identification for enhanced security in online credit card payments.
- card: Credit card provider (Master, Visa, Diners).
